**Features:**

**How to Use:**

1. **Save the code:** Create three files:
   - `index.html`: Paste the provided HTML code.
   - `style.css`: Paste the provided CSS code.

2. **Open the HTML file:** Use a web browser to open `index.html`.

**Customization:**

- **Images:** Replace the image filenames in the HTML code with your own images.
- **Colors:** The CSS variables (`--background`, `--imgBox`, etc.) control the overall color scheme. Adjust them to match your preferences.
- **Text:** Modify the content within the `name` and `fullName` classes in the HTML code to display your desired text information.

**Additional Notes:**
